London has become the home of the Global ServerlessDays movement. There will be over 20 ServerlessDays events this year. The conference that started it all (with JeffConf in 2017) is back for its third year and will be bigger and better than ever!

We're keeping the same focus and identity as before ("One day, One track, One community") but adding in new features based on feedback from previous events.

The conference will focus again on talks from the serverless community telling stories all about the why, how and what they are doing with serverless technologies in 2019. London’s serverless community is one of the largest and most experienced in the world. We’ll be adding to an incredible line-up with expert speakers from around the world for the keynotes.

Serverless Days London will be largest Serverless conference in Europe in 2019 with up to 500 attendees. This is almost double the number of attendees from the 2018 event .

Our commitment to keeping the ticket price low continues. We're looking to ensure that everybody who wants to come, has every opportunity to.

### Format

Conference format will be similar be previous events. Single track sessions (aiming at a mix of experience levels) including keynote sessions, normal conference talks, lightning talks, and open spaces to discuss and meet others.

### CFP

Share your Serverless experiences at ServerlessDays London. The CFP is now open until 13 May 2019. Submit to the CFP [here](https://www.papercall.io/serverlessdaysldn2019)

### Workshops

We are aiming to have a day of workshops on various serverless topics on the 10th July. We'll be announcing these as they become confirmed by sponsors. This will include workshops for no extra cost and be open to anyone with a conference ticket (on a first come first served basis).
Keep an eye out for further announcements on the workshops.

### Diversity and Inclusion

Just like serverless, we have come a long way in two years! What doesn’t change is our commitment to building an inclusive community. 

Key to our plans has been the Diversity and Inclusion programme, which provides free tickets to those who need them. These tickets are sponsored by other attendees. This is a key part of what makes this conference so special.

Once again, we're again asking those who are able to afford the extra ticket price, to buy Diversity Sponsorship tickets. This enables those who cannot afford to come to come to the conference for free. This means a huge amount to us to continue to run this programme.

In 2018, we used White Coat Captioning to provide live captioning for all conference talks. We’re delighted to announce this will once again be happening for the 2019 event.

### Venue

More attendees means a bigger venue and we're having to say goodbye to our spiritual home in [St John's Church in Hoxton](http://www.stjohnshoxton.org.uk/). The new venue will be based out of [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

The new venue allows us to cater for more attendees. We'd like to say a huge thank you to the previous venue team. Without them there would be no ServerlessDays London!

### The Team

(In Alphabetical Order)

__Ant Stanley__ runs the ServerlessDays London meetup group, is the main driving force behind the Global Organising Team of ServerlessDays, and also does a mean impression of a GraphQL expert, whilst also knowing how to build awesome Serverless solutions. He tweets at [@iamstan](https://twitter.com/iamstan) and blogs at [@iamstan](https://medium.com/@iamstan).

__Ginny Follen__ is one of the new members to the team in 2019. Previously she was a Marketing Director for Optimizely based in London. With many years running and sponsoring tech events, she brings a wealth of experience to the team.

__Hanna Cevick__ is the other addition to the team this year. She's the head of marketing at Reason, a London based digital product agency, that is all in on Serverless technologies. She can be found on Twitter at [@bestofallhans](https://twitter.com/bestofallhans)

__James Thomas__ works as the Developer Advocate Lead for Serverless at IBM Cloud. This mostly involves telling everybody how amazing Apache OpenWhisk (and IBM Cloud Functions) is...
