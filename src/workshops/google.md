# Build a Serverless Web Store

Build a serverless web store using Google Cloud's serverless stack! Along the way, you'll learn how to convert an App Engine app to Cloud Run, use Cloud Functions for event driven processing, and use Cloud Firestore, a fully managed serverless NoSql database.

We'll set up CI/CD, monitoring and alerting. Then once we have the app in place, we'll step through using our Data Analytics tools process clickstream data. All with no servers to manage...
