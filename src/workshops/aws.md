# Serverless Security Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn techniques to secure a serverless application built with AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway and RDS Aurora. We will cover AWS services and features you can leverage to improve the security of a serverless applications in 5 domains: identity & access management, infrastructure, data, code, logging & monitoring.

You'll start by deploying a simple serverless application. However, this application is not very secure, and we need your help to implement measures to protect this serverless API from attackers. By following different modules covering various aspects of security, you will help improve the security of the application.
