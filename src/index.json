We need to create and maintain secure, performant, observable, maintainable systems. We also need to be looking out for what is coming next, to keep providing value to our organisations. \n\r With this in mind we have a fantastic lineup, covering security, testing, serverless on the edge, big data and machine learning. We look to the future, with talks on WebAssembly and the new WebAssembly System Interface. We also have enterprises sharing what they're doing today in production. We hope this year's edition of ServerlessDays London will have something for everyone.",

As Solomon Hykes, co-founder of Docker, said, 'If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, you wouldn't have needed us to create Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing.' But WASI will be useful for so many other use cases, too. In this talk, Lin and Till will share with you how WASI works and explore how different use cases can benefit from it.",

Neighbouring the Science Museum on one side and the Royal Albert Hall on the other, with the Natural History Museum and Victoria & Albert Museum a stone's throw away. Imperial College gives us the space to grow, whilst still offering an accessible event. ",
