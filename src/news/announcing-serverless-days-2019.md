ServelessDays is coming to Australia with its debut being held in Sydney!

The conference will focus on talks from the serverless community telling stories all about the why, how and what they are doing with serverless technologies in 2019. Weâ€™ll be adding to an incredible line-up with expert speakers from around the world for the keynotes.

We're looking to ensure that everybody who wants to come, has every opportunity to by offering the diversity sponsorship tickets.

### Format

Conference format will be single track sessions (aiming at a mix of experience levels) including keynote sessions, normal conference talks, lightning talks, and open spaces to discuss and meet others.

### Diversity and Inclusion

Key to the success of ServerlessDays worldwide has been the Diversity and Inclusion programme, which provides free tickets to those who need them. These tickets are sponsored by other attendees. This is a key part of what makes this conference so special.

Once again, we're again asking those who are able to afford the extra ticket price, to buy Diversity Sponsorship tickets. This enables those who cannot afford to come to come to the conference for free. This means a huge amount to us to continue to run this programme.

### Venue

We've found an amazing venue for the conference: [Darlinghurst Theatre Company](https://www.darlinghursttheatre.com/). This venue puts on great events (usually plays), offering our attendees food, coffee and drinks at the bar (ask us about our Drinks Sponsorshop!). We're certain everybody will love the venue.
