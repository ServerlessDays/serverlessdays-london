# CORVID19 (Coronavirus) Update

### 20th March 2020

ServerlessDays Sydney is currently scheduled for August 19, 2020.

The organising committee for ServerlessDays Sydney is actively and continuously monitoring the COVID-19 virus outbreak in line with Australian Government public health advice and the World Health Organization (WHO). 

As of March 20, the conference is still over four months away. However, the situation is very fluid and changing daily. The Australian Government has advised that non-essential outside gatherings should be limited to 500 people. There is a chance this guidance will also soon apply to indoor gatherings of 100 people. 

While there is still time, we are adopting a cautious approach before we postpone the event. The safety of all participants, from sponsors to speakers to attendees to volunteers, is our priority.

We are going to make a final decision on the event proceeding on **June 4, 2020**. 

In the meantime we are pausing ticket sales and sponsorship activity. Tickets that have already been purchased will be proactively refunded. Our sponsors are aware of our current position, and we thank them for their continued support of our conference and community events.

We will continue to monitor the situation. You can read the latest on our website or twitter at any time. Please contact us via the website should you have any concerns.
