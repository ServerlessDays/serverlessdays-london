# Tickets

We aim to keep ServerlessDays events accessible. A big part of that is making them financially accessible. The majority of ServerlessDays costs are covered by sponsors, which enables us to offer afforable tickets. 

<!-- In addition to afforable tickets we run a scholarship program for under represented minorities in tech, through **diversitytickets.org** which you can [apply for here](https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/420). -->

If you are a member of the press or a tech analyst you can apply for tickets via emailing us at [sydney@serverlessdays.io](mailto:sydney@serverlessdays.io)
