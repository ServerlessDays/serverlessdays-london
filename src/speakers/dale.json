        "description": "A Cloud Guru has been a Serverless company from day one. Being a Serverless company does not necessarily mean that we started with the patterns & architectures that would effectively allow us to scale out our development team. This talk will be a brief history and analysis of our original architecture, deployment strategy, service communication. I will then contrast that history against our new ideas and approaches to building Serverless architectures. ",
