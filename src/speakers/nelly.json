        "description": "Applications that use real-time updates increase the fairness and data transparency among your users, and the bi-directional interactions between connected clients and server helps reduce the bursting traffic challenges introduced by traditional web-style interactions. Traditionally, it was not possible to go Serverless with real-time applications. However, by leveraging Azure SignalR Services you, can build Serverless solutions and enjoy building modern Real-time applications. In this session Nelly will demonstrate how developers can quickly build a solution for real-time apps with Azure’s SignalR Service and using serverless technology in the Azure cloud with Azure App Services, Azure Storage and Azure Functions.
