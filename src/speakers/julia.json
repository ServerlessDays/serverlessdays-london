        "description": "Choosing the right boss is just as important as choosing the right organisation. Why? Because having a genuine culture is driven by leadership and the people you work with. Whether you are looking at joining a new organisation, growing your career in your current organisation or thinking about whether to stay or leave your current position, understanding what workplace culture you thrive in should be at the forefront of you decision making. Julia will be chatting through what workplace culture actually is (beyond the beer fridge and table tennis table), how to identify an organisation with a culture of innovation and what the connection is between culture and enjoying your working life.
