        "description": "Contrary to the current narrative, serverless is not at its core a technology—it's an approach to development that delivers true business value. Serverless is a mindset. It's the direction modern software teams choose to go in rather than a destination they stop at. In this talk, Stackery’s Ecosystems Director, Farrah Campbell, will define what the “serverless state of mind” means to her, her road to get there, and how she uses this mindset as a compass to guide decision-making for both personal and professional goals. From unlocking a better development workflow to furthering career growth and satisfaction, we can all benefit from adopting a serverless state of mind. ",

        "bio": "After 10 years of working in healthcare management, a serendipitous 20-minute car ride with Kara Swisher inspired Farrah to make the jump into technology. She has worked at multiple startups in many different capacities, eventually working her way to being the Ecosystems Director for Stackery in Portland, Oregon. As the Stackery Ecosystems Director, Farrah has managed the Stackery relationship with AWS including Stackery as an Advanced Technology Partner, achieving the AWS DevOps Competency, a launch partner for Lambda Layers. Farrah has cultivated the serverless community as an organizer of Portland Serverless Days, the Portland Serverless Meetup, along with numerous serverless workshops and the Portland tech community events from Techfest to bringing multiple luminaries to Portland. She has been featured on The Cube, Faas and Furious, and in her spare time dabbles in IoT buttons and Lambdas. ",
