            "abstract" : "New technologies arise every year.  Some come and leave in a flash, while others shape how the world builds software.  Where does serverless fit in the mix?  Serverless has already created ripples in the ecosystem, but the major tipping point is yet to be seen.  Understand how organizations and teams are beginning to shift their thinking from the bleeding edge of serverless to a brand new serverless paradigm that will enable developers to build applications across every scenario more powerfully than ever."
